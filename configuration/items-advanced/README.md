# Items (advanced)

This page describe all possible additional properties that you may use for your custom items.

## Vanilla options

### displayname

This allows you to change the name displayed on the top of an item.

```yaml
  displayname: "&c&lExample" #example name
```

### material
This allows you to change the base material for your item (the base material will decide the base functionalities for your item), represented as Bukkit Material.

```yaml
  material: WOODEN_SWORD
```

### color
This allow you to change the color if the base material is a dyeable item (Leather Horse Armor) or a item that can have color (such as Potion). The format is RGB.

```yaml
  color: 3, 252, 136
```

### lore
This allow you to add lore to your item (basically a set of text in your item's tooltip). Multiple lore can be added.

```yaml
lore:
  - "One line"
  - "&aAnother line"
```

### injectID
This allows Oraxen to know recognise the item, it is by default set to true and you should not have to change it. If you do it anyway, the mechanics of the items will no longer work.

```yaml
  injectID: false
```

### excludeFromInventory
This option allows you to exclude an item from the oraxen inventory. It will no longer be displayed but you can still get it using [oraxen give command](../../usage/commands.md#get-the-items). It is useful for items used in  other plugins like inventory icons.

```yaml
  excludeFromInventory: true
```

### durability
Allow you to change the damage of an item (?) Not very useful

```yaml
  durability: 10
```

### unbreakable
The name say it all, make your item unbreakable (for real by using Minecraft's dedicated property)

```yaml
unbreakable: true
```

### ItemFlags
Allow you to set some Flags property, see all possible flags [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html)

```yaml
  ItemFlags:
    - HIDE_ENCHANTS
    - HIDE_ATTRIBUTES
    - HIDE_UNBREAKABLE
    - HIDE_DESTROYS
    - HIDE_PLACED_ON
    - HIDE_POTION_EFFECTS
```

### PotionEffects

This allows you to add custom Potion Effects to your potion. Get the list of available effects [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html).

```yaml
  PotionEffects:
    # - type: Get the list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/potion/PotionEffectType.html
    # - duration: in ticks
    # - amplifier: potion effects level
    # - ambient: true/false, makes potion effect produce more, translucent, particles.
    # - particles: true/false, whether this effect has particles or not
    # - icon: true/false, whether this effect has an icon or not
    - { type: WITHER,
        duration: 200,
        amplifier: 2,
        ambient: false,
        particles: true,
        icon: true }
```

### AttributeModifiers

This allows you to add minecraft attributes to your item. They are very powerful and allow you to make an item that adds hearts, increases the player's speed, etc. Get the list of available attributes [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/attribute/Attribute.html).

```yaml
  AttributeModifiers:
    # - name: You don't really care about the name but it can be useful for some developers
    # - attribute: Get the list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/attribute/Attribute.html
    # - operations: 0 for ADD_NUMBER, 1 for ADD_SCALAR, 2 for MULTIPLY_SCALAR_1;
    # - uuid: put a random uuid, generate one here: https://www.uuidgenerator.net/
    # - slot: HAND, OFF_HAND, FEET, LEGS, CHEST or HEAD
    - {name: "oraxen_speed", 
       attribute: GENERIC_MOVEMENT_SPEED, 
       amount: 0.1, 
       operation: 0, 
       uuid: 3a25f0b5-dbda-4e38-b097-9e75e37ae464, 
       slot: HAND}
```

### Enchantments

If you want to enchant your item (even with non vanilla levels like for example sharpness 15), you can do it with this section.

```yaml
  Enchantments:
    protection: 4
    flame: 34
    sharpness: 18
```

    generate_model: true
    parent_model: "custom/items/generated_elite"
    textures:
      - custom/items/elite_zombie_walk
